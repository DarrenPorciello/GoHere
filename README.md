# GoHere
Created with my team at UofT Hacks, GoHere allows you to view a live map of current events happening in your area. Users are able to post pings with a discription of an event on a live map that others users can access. The goal of this is to allow users to better explore their communities and connect with each other through local events and gatherings.
